## Cellular Neural Network (CNN) Friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CoNN)

The two sub-directories in this directory include implementations of CNN friendly CoNNs. Some basic background information about CoNNs can be found [here]. In order to make these networks CNN friendly only slight changes needed to be made to the original CoNNs. For example, the convolutions in a CNN friendly CoNN need to be 3x3. There are implementations of these CNN friendly networks for [2 MNIST classes] and [10 MNIST classes].
