## Cellular Neural Network (CNN) Friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CoNN)

The two sub-directories in this directory include implementations of CNN friendly CoNNs. In order to make these networks CNN friendly only slight changes needed to be made to the original CoNNs. For example, the convolutions in a CNN friendly CoNN need to be 3 by 3. There are implementations of these CNN friendly networks for [2 MNIST classes] and [10 MNIST classes].
